# JL Audio 13TW5v2 Subwoofer Mounting Bracket

This is useful for fiberglass enclosures that do not have a good strong mounting surface to put fasteners into. 

To install this drill M5 size holes into the enclosure cutout using the sub as a guide for the hole placement. Then use double sided tape to hold these brackets in place aligned with the holes in the enclosure. Now you can install the subwoofer and thread M5 screws into these brackets.

Holes use m5x10 heatset inserts. 

Fusion 360 source file included.
