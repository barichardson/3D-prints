# Rear Speaker 3.5" adapter for Nissan 370Z

** WORK IN PROGRESS **

Adapter to mount 3.5" speaker in rear location of a Nissan 370Z. This will require modifying the interior panel by cutting out the center hole in existing speaker grill and grinding the front surface flat. Only cut out the center area that already has holes. You will also have to cut off all of the mounting standoffs on the back side so there is a flat surface.

Cutout and speaker mounting holes designed to fit Stereo Integrity M3 Midrange.

Speaker mounting holes use m4x6 heatset inserts. 

Fusion 360 source file included.
