# LSI 9305-24i fan shroud

Fan shroud for LSI 9305-24i using Noctua NF-A4x10.

The cutout for the fan is a tight fit to allow for installation without any fasteners.

The fan shroud is held in place with tabs that hook under the pci bracket and also has small extrusions that hook under the heatsink for a very secure fit.

This design will likely work with 9503-16i as well.

Fusion 360 source file included.
