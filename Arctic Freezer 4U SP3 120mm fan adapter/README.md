# Arctic Freezer 4U SP3 120mm fan adapter

Adapter to mount standard 120mm fans on Arctic Freezer 4U SP3 heatsink.

This will clear standard (non-heatsink) sized ECC RDIMMs with ~1mm clearance with the bracket. Mount can be shifted up higher on the heasink to clear taller DIMMs.

Since the heatsink fins tend to hang on the mounting brackets I recommend installing this from the front by hooking one side into the heatsink then pushing on the other side until it locks into place.
To remove the adapter pry the tabs on one side being careful not to break them off. 

Fusion 360 source file included.
